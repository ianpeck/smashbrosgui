# Smash Bros GUI

Set this GUI up to check statistics from my Super Smash Bros, Amazon RDS-hosted database. It is filled with data a WWE-style franchise my brother and I made with SSB characters when we were younger! Some of the data has been manually loaded into my database from a hand written notebook.

For now, it simply displays basic win-loss data based on different criteria (W/L on certain stages, against certain characters, etc) along with pictures of the fighters/stage they fought on. Eventually planning on adding a more advanced stats tab to the GUI, a tab that plots statisical graphs for you, and another that grants the ability to ETL data into Amazon RDS as well!

This repos code is available for you to download but will not work unless your IP is granted SELECT access to my database. Please reach out to me at ianpeck22@gmail.com with your IP and I will add you to it.
