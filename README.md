# Smash Bros GUI

Set this GUI up to check statistics from my Super Smash Bros, Amazon RDS-hosted database. It is filled with data a WWE-style franchisemy brother and I made with SSB characters when we were younger! Some of the data has been manually loaded into my database from a hand written notebook.

For now, it simply displays basic win-loss data based on different criteria (W/L on certain stages, against certain characters, etc) along with pictures of the fighters/stage they fought on. Eventually planning on adding a more advanced stats tab to the GUI, a tab that plots statisical graphs for you, and another that grants the ability to ETL data into Amazon RDS as well!

This repos code is available for you to download but will not work unless your IP is granted access to my database. Until I add SQL string injection protection into the GUI, no additional IP's will be added to the security group.
