# Smash Bros GUI

Set this GUI up to check statistics from my Super Smash Bros, Amazon RDS-hosted database. It is filled with data a WWE-style franchisemy brother and I made with SSB characters when we were younger! Some of the data has been manually loaded into my database from a hand written notebook.

For now, it simply displays basic win-loss data based on different criteria (W/L on certain stages, against certain characters, etc) along with pictures of the fighters/stage they fought on. Eventually planning on adding a more advanced stats tab to the GUI, a tab that plots statisical graphs for you, and another that grants the ability to ETL data into Amazon RDS as well!
